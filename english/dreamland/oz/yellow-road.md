You look down at your feet, and find yourself stepping on
[yellow bricks](https://youtu.be/THbY7EL8k5w).

The road leads to the Emerald City, where you are lucky to run into Dorothy,
the Tin Man, and a flying monkey. You all sit down and have lunch consisting of

- green jello
- celery
- green grapes
- kiwis
- guacamole
- broccoli

See the theme? Well, in the Emerald city, green food is quite popular!
