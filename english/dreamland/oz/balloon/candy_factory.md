The wizard lets down a rope ladder from the hot air balloon basket, and you
scamper up it. The balloon takes you high into the atmosphere, somewhere over
the rainbow, in fact.

A few hours later, you begin to descend. A large glass box shoots up to the
right of the balloon. It is rectangular and has lots of buttons inside. As well
as a few people. It reminds you of an elevator car -- a great glass elevator!

Strange, but what can you expect from a dream? As you can closer to the ground,
you see a hole punched into the roof of a large factory building.

The wizard lowers the balloon inside the hole, and you are soon surrounded by
a [landscape of candy](https://youtu.be/RZ-uV72pQKI).
