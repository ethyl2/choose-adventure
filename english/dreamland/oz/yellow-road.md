You look down at your feet, and find yourself stepping on
[yellow bricks](https://youtu.be/THbY7EL8k5w).

The road leads to the Emerald City, where you are lucky to run into Dorothy,
the Tin Man, and a flying monkey. You all sit down and have lunch consisting of

- green jello
- celery
- green grapes
- kiwis
- guacamole
- broccoli

See the theme? Well, in the Emerald city, green food is quite popular!

The Now-Not-So-Cowardly Lion jumps on the lunch table and growls at you.
You don't know why suddenly you are his enemy, but you realize it might be a
good idea to get away fast. Do you:

- look down at your [ruby slippers](slippers/green-gables.md)?

or

- look up at the [hot air balloon](balloon/candy-factory.md) in the sky, piloted by the Wizard?
